# Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification

## Objective

Train a logistic Regression model to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica and virginica species based on their measurement.

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning
- Label Encoding
- Logistic Regression
- Evaluation with Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and Accuracy Score.

## Final Results
- **Accuracy:** 100%

## Files
- ' Iris.csv' : Dataset
- 'iris_logistic_model.pkl' : Saved trained model
- 'iris_task3.ipynb' : Jupyter Notebook with all code

## Conclusion
The Model demonstrates strong accuracy for classifying Iris Species using simple logistic Regression.
