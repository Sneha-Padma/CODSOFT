#Task2 - Movie Rating Prediction

## Objective
Building a ML model that can predicts mobie rating based on attributes

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Label Encoding for Categorical Features
- Linear Regression for Prediction
- Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error and r2_score
## Final Results
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression
- **R2_Score:** 0.14
- **MSE:** 1.60

## Visualization
The model's prediction were plotted against actual ratings to show the meet point.

## Conclusion
The model gives a fair accurate estimation of movie rating using basic regression. This project strengthens understanding of regression, encoding, and data prep.
